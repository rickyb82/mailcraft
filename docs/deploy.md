# Deploying MailCraft for a framework (Docker, multi-user)

> **Last updated:** 2026-10-13

MailCraft's server (`mailcraft-cli serve`) can host **one mailbox client per user of your
framework**: each user has their own accounts, passwords and cache under `/data/users/<user>/`,
the framework authenticates with a service token, and users get per-user tokens for the web
page and for their MCP assistant. Nothing is shared between users.

## Run it

```sh
docker build -t mailcraft .
docker run -d --name mailcraft -p 127.0.0.1:7878:7878 -v mailcraft-data:/data \
  -e MAILCRAFT_TOKEN='a-long-random-secret' -e MAILCRAFT_LANG=it mailcraft
```

or `MAILCRAFT_TOKEN=… docker compose up -d`. The container serves the web app at `/` and the API
under `/api/`. Put your framework or an HTTPS reverse proxy in front: the service token and the
user tokens travel in `Authorization: Bearer …`, so the connection must be TLS beyond localhost.

Without Docker: `mailcraft-cli serve --bind 0.0.0.0:7878 --users-dir /data/users --token SECRET
--static dist/web` (the web app built with `trunk build --release` in `apps/mailcraft-web`).

## Identity: how the framework names the user

Every API call carries a token:

| Token | Who | Names the user with |
|---|---|---|
| the **service token** (`MAILCRAFT_TOKEN`) | the framework's backend | header `X-Mailcraft-User: <user id>` (or `?user=`) |
| a **user token** | the browser page or the user's MCP process | nothing: the token *is* the user |

User ids are slugged (`Anna Rossi` → `anna-rossi`); use your framework's stable user id.

### Minting a user token (service token only)

```http
POST /api/users/<user>/token
Authorization: Bearer <service token>
→ {"user": "anna-rossi", "token": "64 hex chars"}
```

`POST /api/users/<user>/revoke` revokes every token of that user (log-out); `GET /api/users`
lists the users with data. Tokens are kept in `/data/users/tokens.json` (user-only file).

## Embedding the web app

When the user opens the mail section of your framework, mint (or reuse) their token and open
the page with it:

```
https://mail.example.com/?token=<user token>&lang=it
```

The page keeps the token in the browser's storage and connects to its own origin (the server
that served it). It can also be hosted elsewhere (GitHub Pages) and pointed at the server with
`?server=https://mail.example.com`; then the server must allow the page's origin (it answers
CORS for any origin, the token is what protects the data).

## MCP per user (the assistant inside your framework)

Run one MCP process per logged-in user, pointed at the server with that user's token:

```sh
mailcraft-cli mcp --server https://mail.example.com --token <user token>
```

It exposes the same tools and prompts as the local MCP server (`docs/mcp.md`), executed on the
server against that user's accounts: *"configura la mia casella Aruba …"*, *"leggi le mail non
lette"*, *"rispondi a Luca…"*. The process is stateless apart from the token, so it can be
started and stopped with the conversation.

## Calling the API directly (framework backend)

```http
POST /api/cmd
Authorization: Bearer <service token>
X-Mailcraft-User: anna-rossi
Content-Type: application/json

{"command": "account.add", "params": {"email": "anna@example.it", "password": "…"}}
→ {"result": {...}}     or     {"error": "…"}
```

Network commands answer `{"result": {"job": 12}}`; `GET /api/snapshot?since=<revision>` returns
the user's state (folders, the mailbox in view, opened messages, finished jobs) when it changed,
`{"unchanged": true}` otherwise. `GET /api/health` needs no token. Every command is listed by
`mailcraft-cli commands` and in `crates/engine/src/cmd.rs`.

## Gmail and Microsoft 365 (OAuth)

The providers accept a redirect URI only on **HTTPS with a host name** (or on `localhost`,
which works only for someone sitting on the server itself): `http://192.168.10.80:8080/…`
is refused by Google with "device_id and device_name are required for private IP". So a
framework on a LAN needs a name and a certificate in front of MailCraft (a reverse proxy with
Let's Encrypt on a real domain, or an internal CA your browsers trust), and MailCraft must
know that address: set `MAILCRAFT_PUBLIC_URL=https://mail.example.com` so every user's
sign-in returns there whatever address they typed. MailCraft refuses to start a sign-in whose
return address a provider would reject, and says why.

Create a *Web application* OAuth client for each provider with the redirect URI
`https://mail.example.com/api/oauth/callback` and give it to the container:
`MAILCRAFT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `MAILCRAFT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (and the `MICROSOFT` pair). Set
`MAILCRAFT_PUBLIC_URL=https://mail.example.com` when the proxy does not send
`X-Forwarded-Proto`/`X-Forwarded-Host`. Users then pick *Google* as sign-in in the account form
and approve in the browser; the provider sends them back to the callback, which completes the
sign-in of the session that started it. Details: [`oauth.md`](oauth.md).

## Data and backups

```
/data/users/<user>/config.json    accounts and preferences
/data/users/<user>/secrets.json   passwords (0600)
/data/users/<user>/cache/         folders and message lists
/data/users/tokens.json           user tokens
```

Back up `/data`; to remove a user, revoke their tokens and delete their directory.

## Limits (0.1)

- Polling, not push: the page asks for changes every 2 s (0.4 s while working).
- No HTTPS in `serve` itself: terminate TLS in the proxy or the framework.
- One server process keeps every active user's IMAP connections; a few hundred users per
  instance is the intended scale.
